The dataset includes 85 images.
Banana-slugs-toy are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 45 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.85 percent of pixels
